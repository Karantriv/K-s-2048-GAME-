Features


Smooth Animations: Tiles move and merge with smooth transitions.
Dynamic Scoring System: The score is displayed at the top of the screen and updates with each tile merge.
Game Over Detection: The game detects when no valid moves are left and displays a "Game Over" screen.
Background Music: Enjoy background music while you play.

How to Play:
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move tiles on the grid.
Tiles with the same number will merge when they collide, forming a tile with the sum of their values.
The goal is to create a tile with 2048, but you can continue playing after that.
The game ends when there are no valid moves left.
